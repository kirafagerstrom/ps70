<h3 style="color:#e2165b";>Final project idea: Smart Pill Box</h3>
I decided to go with the Smart Pill Box idea to guide the user when filling thei rmedication organizer. Here's the description from Week One again: <br>
A lot of smart pillboxes focus on reminding the user when to take their medications. My idea aims to make the other end of medication administration, filling the pillbox, easier. The idea is inspired by a couple of friends and relatives with chronic illnesses whose prescriptions change from month to month, making their medication schedules pretty complicated. 

<br>
<br>

<h5><em><b>How it works</b></em></h5>
The organizer would look like a standard seven-day box, with each day divided into morning and night. It would sit on a base that puts lights under each compartment. At the beginning of each week, the user would input the instructions on the original bottle's label like "take 2 capsules every other day in the morning", either using buttons on the box or an interface on a computer/phone (maybe a website?). The corresponding compartments would light up based on the given schedule. Future iterations could include a reminder feature or an indication of how many pills to put in each compartment (i.e. the <a href="https://elliegrid.com/products/ellie-smart-pill-box">Ellie Grid</a>).<br>
<br>



<h4><b>CAD model</b></h4>
The first model I've made recapitulates a classic medication organizer design with 2 rows of 7 compartments for each day. Each compartment is a 3x3x3 snap-fit box that opens with a hinge. <br>

I'm not exactly sure how the electronic components will work or how they'll fit on the board, but I'm envisioning an LED either on the lid or on the outer edge of each box that turns on to indicate that a medication dose belongs in that box. <a href="./full box v2.stl" download>Here is the STL file of the design</a>.
